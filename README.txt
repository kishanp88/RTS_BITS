1. Use any Python IDE to run the code
2. Enter the number of tasks 
3. Code will then prompt you to provide period, execution time and deadline for each respective task
4. Priority is based on 'Deadline Monotonic' algorithm
5. In result, busy intervals of all levels, schedulability of all jobs of all the tasks as wll as final schedulability will be 
displayed based on time demand analysis.

Sample test cases:
1) T1(3, 1.25, 3.5) , T1(2, 1, 2) , T1(5, 0.25, 6)
2) T1(3, 1.25, 3.1) , T1(2, 1, 2) , T1(5, 0.25, 6)
3) T1(3, 1.25, 3) , T1(2, 1, 2) , T1(5, 0.25, 5)
